What is Double Cleansing?

Our double cleanse regimen is a modern take on this beneficial, centuries-old cleansing ritual. It is the best way to remove all traces of sunscreen, pollutants, bacteria-causing grime, excess oil and sweat that might be left on the surface of your skin at the end of the day, without clogging your pores, upsetting your pH balance or stripping your skin of its natural moisture.

Double Cleansing won’t complicate your regular regimen. It only includes one more nourishing step.
